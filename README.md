ðŸ©¸This is a program to graph the Libre Freestyle readings in realtime. If it goes under 4.0 mmol/L it will sound an alarm and speak text stating your in Hypo. You may change this in the code to suit your needs. Only works in English however you can change this if you want. When run for the first time you will have to enter your username and password from your Libre Freestyle app. Then it will load the Matplotlib graph and give time and readings for 12 hours or so. If you have any questions just comment me on Redit.

** Added a MySQL option where you create a mysql_config.json in your documents folder like this

{  
        "host":"hostname",
        "user":"username",
        "password":"password123",
        "database":"databasename"
}

And simply run the program later you can use the MySQL data in other programs to manipulate them how ever you wish.

Just one thing it interferes with the Screen Saver when if you want I have another project which solves that problem.
